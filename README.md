# Etch-A-Sketch

This is my solution following The Odin Project's curriculum. This program has the ability similar to that of an Etch-A-Sketch, hence the name. By incorporating JS, CSS, and HTML, a drawing project has been developed where the user can input a grid size ranging from 1 to 100, as well as the ability to erase from the drawing, add random rainbow colors, and choose your own color within the program. 

The main difficulty found while programming this project was making the grid size stay consistent when the grid changes within the program based on the user input. In addition, there was difficulty in implementing a way to continuously update the cells of the grid that would allow the cells to have the 'click' function to be on them. The logic between the color, rainbow, and erase buttons were also complicated as there were some logical conflicts within each other.

In the future, I hope to add the feature to get rid of all outlines, as well as make the pen to be adjustable in size so that it is not as hard to paint larger areas when the grid is large.
